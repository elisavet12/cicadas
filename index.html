      <ul>
        <li>They have been waiting 17 years under the trees.</li>
        <li>On a warm spring night their wait comes to an end</li>
        <li>Night after night they emerge in millions together. It's their only defense.</li>
        <li>They climb to seek a secure perch on which to transform. Their final few weeks of their 17-years lives has just began.</li>
        <li>For the first few days, the new adults rest and recover, and wait for their shells to harden.</li>
        <li> Soon after the males begin to call to the females. Their synchronized chorus is among the loudest sounds in nature.</li>
        <li>But not all survive long enough to find a mate.</li>
        <li>Soon after the females lay eggs they punch deep holes into branches and deposits hundreds of eggs inside.</li>
        <li>With that act their lives are complete, as quickly as they appear, their numbers dwindle until the last one fades away.</li>
        <li>But up in the trees, hidden in the branches, billions of eggs are about to hatch.</li>
        <li>They crawl to the edge of their branch, and drop away. Instinct drives them to seek refuge underground.</li>
        <li>And the cycle begins again!</li>
      </ul>
